## Overview

I am a **Software Engineer (Full-Stack | Security-Aware)** focused on building **production-grade systems** with a strong emphasis on **security, authentication, and backend integrity**.

My work combines modern web engineering with **practical security testing**, defensive design, and real-world deployment considerations. I approach systems not only as a developer, but also with the mindset of an attacker and defender.

---

## Digital Journey

My journey began with the fundamentals of web development and progressively evolved into building and maintaining **end-to-end systems** covering:

- frontend architecture
- backend services and APIs
- database design and access control
- authentication, authorization, and payment flows
- deployment, configuration, and environment security

Today, my focus is on building **secure full-stack applications** where security is considered from the first design decision rather than added later.

---

## Continued Learning & Security Focus

As my engineering skills matured, I expanded deeply into **security-aware development** and offensive/defensive testing practices.

Key areas of continuous development include:

- secure API design and authentication flows
- role-based access control and privilege separation
- database-level security using PostgreSQL Row Level Security (RLS)
- secure handling of secrets, tokens, and environment configuration
- understanding real attack surfaces in modern web applications

Alongside development, I actively practice **bug bounty methodologies**, combining reconnaissance, manual testing, and controlled experimentation to identify weaknesses in authentication, authorization, and API logic.

## Academic Background

**BSc (Hons) Computer Networking & Cybersecurity**  
London Metropolitan University  
Expected graduation: 2025

### Academic Progress
- **First Year completed with high academic results**
- **Second Year completed successfully**, with strong focus on networking, security, and systems design

### Academic Focus & Research
During my studies, I have conducted multiple academic and practical research activities related to:

- Intrusion Detection and **Intrusion Prevention Systems (IDS / IPS)**
- Network traffic analysis and attack pattern recognition
- Security controls at network and application layers
- Defensive strategies against unauthorized access and abuse

These research activities strengthened my understanding of how real-world attacks manifest and how layered security controls mitigate them.

## Bug Bounty & Security Research

I actively practice **bug bounty-style security research**, focusing on:

- authentication bypass scenarios
- authorization and privilege escalation issues
- API misuse and logic flaws
- improper access controls and token handling

I am experienced in documenting findings clearly and professionally, producing structured reports that explain:
- vulnerability impact
- reproduction steps
- security implications
- mitigation recommendations

This experience strengthens my ability to design systems defensively and anticipate abuse cases during development.
